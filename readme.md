# Thesis Data 0.0.1

Thesis data is a data set created for my master thesis on the 
classification of openAPI specification JSON Files. 

You will find all relevant files of my design research process

:no_entry: The code for the PoC of the classifier can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/pmanlukas/colab)

## Here a short discription on the Notebooks:

- classes verification: notebook showing the underlying samples of the clusters resulting from the clustering
- paths: notebook analyzing the path objects of each sample and creating dataframes for clustering
- clustering: notebook clustering the data set samples regarding structure and its content
- combine dataframes: notebook showing results of the clustering in R and comparing the results of each approach
- completness: notebook analyzing the completeness of fields of the samples
- cortical: notebook playing around with the cortical API
- dataset labels: notebook consolidating the results of clustering in classes and uploading the resulting data sets to blobs
- edx: notebook to test certain concepts used in other notebooks
- exploreDatabase: notebook that accessed the mongoDB (is deprecated)

## Here a short discription on the folders:
- .idea: folder of Pycharm (only binaries, will be deleted)
- R: folder will contain all R scripts and files used in project
- clustering: folder containing all files and results of clustering approaches
- notebooks html: the html version of the used Jupyter Notebooks
- obj: folder containing all pickle objects used in the design process
- specs: folder containing all data regarding the specifications
- visualization: folder containing other visualizations

### The other files are currently still in active usage. Over time they are consolidated in existing or new folders!
